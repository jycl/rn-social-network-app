# Simple Social Networking App

This repository provides the code to install and run a mobile application that retrieves and displays data from [`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Description

The application mocks a social networking app that displays a list of users that can be looked up for more details. The user's post history, photo albums, and todo list can also be displayed (though the backend does not provide any proper readable strings).

This application was intended to run on **iOS** devices and may not be bug-free when running on other devices. In addition, it has only been tested on the Simulator (v10.0) provided by XCode.

## Installation

1. Clone repository into local environment
2. Navigate to the project folder via CLI
3. Run `npm install` in order to download dependencies for application.
4. Run `react-native run-ios` in order to set up and start the application.
